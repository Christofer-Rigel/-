    <h1>What is pizza?</h1>
    <div class="main">
        <p>Pizza is a universally cherished dish that originated in Italy. It's traditionally made with a round, flattened dough base that's baked in an oven. The classic Italian pizza, known as "pizza Margherita," is topped with a simple yet delicious combination of tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil leaves. This trio of ingredients represents the colors of the Italian flagâ€”red, white, and green.

            Modern pizza has evolved into various styles across the globe. The dough is typically made from wheat flour, water, yeast, and salt. After rising and being rolled out, it can be topped with a wide array of ingredients. These toppings can include a variety of cheeses, meats like pepperoni and sausage, vegetables such as bell peppers and mushrooms, and even unconventional items like pineapple and anchovies.
            
            The base sauce is usually tomato-based, though alternatives like pesto or cream sauces can be used. The pizza is then baked at a high temperature, often in a wood-fired oven, which helps to achieve a crispy crust and perfectly melted cheese.
            
            Pizza is not only a popular meal but also a cultural icon. It has inspired regional variations such as Chicago's deep-dish pizza, New York's thin-crust pizza, and Detroit's square pizza. Each style brings its unique twist to the dish, highlighting different textures and flavors.
            
            The social aspect of pizza is also significant. It's a go-to choice for gatherings, parties, and casual meals, making it a symbol of communal dining and shared enjoyment. Pizza's versatility allows it to cater to diverse tastes and dietary preferences, including vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options.
            
            Over time, pizza has become more than just a food item; it's a culinary canvas that invites creativity. From gourmet toppings to experimental crusts, the possibilities are endless, ensuring that pizza remains a beloved favorite worldwide.</p>
