        <p class="card-text">Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg in the German Empire. His family later moved to Munich, where he began his schooling. At the age of 17, Einstein enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich. In 1903, Einstein married Mileva Mariƒá, a Serbian physics student, and they had three children: Lieserl, Hans, and Eduard. He worked at the Swiss Patent Office while producing much of his remarkable work in his spare time.

            Einstein's "miracle year" came in 1905 when he published four groundbreaking papers, including the theory of special relativity and the famous equation

            . He received his doctorate from the University of Zurich in 1905 and later held academic positions in Zurich, Prague, and Berlin. In 1914, Einstein became a German citizen and was appointed Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Physical Institute in Berlin. He developed the theory of general relativity in 1916, which revolutionized our understanding of gravity.
            
            Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. He continued to work on unified field theories and made significant contributions to quantum mechanics. In 1933, due to the rise of the Nazi regime, Einstein renounced his German citizenship and emigrated to the United States. He took a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he remained until his death on April 18, 1955. Einstein's work has had a profound impact on modern physics and our understanding of the universe. He is remembered as one of the greatest scientists of all time.</p>
